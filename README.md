# elephentity-codegen-sqlite

Build-time SQLite generator for Elephentity's PHP runtime. It emits a storage
manifest and an explicit initial schema installer for `elephentity/sqlite`.
No WordPress package is required.

## Install

```sh
composer require --dev elephentity/codegen-sqlite:dev-main
cargo build --release --locked --manifest-path vendor/elephentity/codegen-sqlite/Cargo.toml
```

Alternatively, run `cargo install --path . --locked` from a checkout and use
`eleph-gen-sqlite` on PATH. Composer provides a shell launcher; it does not compile
Rust automatically. Production needs only the runtime and generated PHP artifacts.

Configure the target in `eleph.json`, alongside your PHP entity target:

```json
{
  "spec": "spec",
  "targets": {
    "php": {
      "builder": "vendor/bin/eleph-gen-php",
      "output": "generated",
      "namespace": "App\\Entity",
      "typeNamespace": "App\\Type"
    },
    "sqlite": {
      "builder": "vendor/bin/eleph-gen-sqlite",
      "output": "generated/sqlite"
    }
  }
}
```

In `spec/project.yml`:

```yaml
project: App
storage:
  driver: sqlite
  tablePrefix: app_
```

`describe` advertises the `sqlite` driver, so the compiler discovers it without a
hardcoded driver addition. This builder speaks protocol 1 and IR 1.2. Use matching
compiler/orchestrator/PHP-builder versions; an older IR is rejected explicitly.

## Generated artifacts

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `storage-manifest.php` | `Eleph\SQLite\Manifest\StorageManifest`: entity tables, field mappings, indexes, edge placements and join tables |
| `install.php` | A closure accepting PDO SQLite and an optional additional table prefix; atomically creates the initial schema |

The orchestrator signs and writes these files. The builder returns JSON and never
writes to the project directory itself.

```php
$database = new Eleph\SQLite\Database('/var/lib/app/data.sqlite');
$install = require __DIR__ . '/generated/sqlite/install.php';
$install($database->pdo); // Explicit installation command, once on a fresh schema.

$manifest = require __DIR__ . '/generated/sqlite/storage-manifest.php';
$storage = new Eleph\SQLite\SQLiteAdaptor(
    $database,
    $manifest->tables,
    new Eleph\SQLite\Sql\FieldMap($manifest->columns),
    $manifest->placements,
    new Eleph\SQLite\Sql\QueryCompiler(placements: $manifest->placements),
);
```

The compiler has already applied `project.storage.tablePrefix` to the IR table names.
If you need an **additional** deployment prefix, pass the same value to
`$install($database->pdo, $prefix)` and `$manifest->withPrefix($prefix)`.
The SQLite prototype's `Database::prefix()` returns `app_`; the adapter itself uses
the table names in the manifest, so do not automatically apply that prefix twice.

## Schema behavior

- Identity columns use `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`.
- Scalars map to SQLite `TEXT`, `INTEGER` or `REAL`; JSON and dates are encoded by the PHP runtime.
- Unique/indexed fields produce indexes. Boolean values, enum values and maximum lengths receive CHECK constraints.
- One-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many edges produce matching placements and foreign keys. Join pairs are unique.
- Foreign keys use `ON DELETE RESTRICT`. The runtime owns cascade/nullify policy and authorization; direct SQL cannot bypass that work through a database cascade.
- Edge columns allow temporary NULL because the unit of work inserts entities before linking them. The runtime enforces required edges.
- Defaults and managed values are supplied by generated PHP/runtime writes, rather than duplicated as SQL defaults.
- Text uses SQLite's default comparison behavior. Clog's custom Unicode collation is not silently applied to other applications.

The installer rejects an existing table and rolls back all changes. It rejects an
existing transaction and enables foreign keys before beginning its own transaction.
It does not modify populated schemas or claim to generate upgrade migrations.
Keep reviewed migrations in the application. Existing SQLite runtime prototype
limitations remain; this package does not fix the core deletion-planner issue noted
in [elephentity#89](https://github.com/hsimah-services/elephentity/issues/89).

## Verify

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
composer --working-dir=tests install --no-interaction --no-plugins --no-scripts
php tests/runtime.php
```

PHP tests use the tagged SQLite/runtime packages, create disposable databases and
run the upstream adapter conformance harness for every relationship shape. They
also check constraints, identifier prefixes, NULL, literal escaping and rollback.

[The standalone example](examples/standalone/eleph.json) combines PHP, SQLite and
GraphQL PHP generation. In the sibling-repository workspace, with the core's Composer
dependencies and all three builders plus the orchestrator built, run:

```sh
php tools/test-pipeline.php /path/to/elephentity-dev
```

This generates from YAML, checks signed output for drift, runs `eleph check` against
actual generated entities and installs the generated SQLite schema. The GraphQL
builder's test dependencies must also be installed for that workspace test.

See [SOURCE.md](SOURCE.md) for the source of reused protocol and fixture code.
